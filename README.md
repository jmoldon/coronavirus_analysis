# Analyis of the evolution of covid-19 cases with time

Analysis of recent coronavirus data for different countries and regions.

Main report is here: [https://jmoldon.github.io/coronavirus_analysis/cvid_report.html](https://jmoldon.github.io/coronavirus_analysis/cvid_report.html)

Data comes from [Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) that is updated daily.

# Changelog
2020-05-16
- Need to change the source database to https://github.com/datasets/covid-19 due to a mismatch with the previous database

2020-05-08
- Fix bug related with how to read user-defined initial guess of parameters

2020-05-07
- New function to fit. Now it can be pure exponential, logistic or double logistic (two contatenated logistics to account for changes in the propagation rate)
- The new option has more free parameters, so it is more sensitive to bad data (like large jumps) and initial conditions.

2020-04-11
- Add plot of deaths per day for 12 countries combined
- Fix date tick labels to be one per week (on Mondays)
- More clear date tick label format

2020-04-04
- Add plots for Spain by Comunidades Aut√≥nomas

2020-03-25
- Added prediction to the number of deaths per day plot
- Changed zorder of Active plots to be lower

2020-03-24
- Have to change the source of data because JHU has changed the format unconsistently and have removed the Recovered data

2020-03-23
- Add increments to all predictions

2020-03-22
- Add stripes to show rate of doubling cases every 2 days
- Fix bug with case differences in the tables
- Added USA per State in the global summary

2020-03-21
- Major refactor of some functions
- Now death rate (per day) is plotted 

2020-03-17
- Mayor refactoring and new functions. 
- Now the report displays predicted number of cases for the next 5 days
- Included USA as aggregated country
- Included Poland
- bound_threshold parameter to manually disable confidence intervals
- Add global plots of evolution of most affected countries over time

2020-03-16 
- Better determination of exponential curve.
- exponential or logistic function is automatically selected based on goodness of fit

2020-03-15
